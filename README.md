- 👋 Hi, I’m @neatlyreckless
- 👀 I’m interested in web3, community building, project management and organic/authentic marketing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, how to build smart contracts for the blockchain, and all things web3/crypto and NFTs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects where I can utilize my current web2 skills in marketing, content writing, graphic design, and community building in a web3 setting. 
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on my Twitter account @neatlyreckess
